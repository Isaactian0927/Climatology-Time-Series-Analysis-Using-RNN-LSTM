# **Climatology Time Series Analysis**

## **Description**
In this project I will demonstrate how to use Deep Learning 
Algorithms, such as the Recurrent [Deep] Neural Network in this 
example, to use SSN (Sunspot Number) to predict climate change.

"A measure of natural phenomenon, the sunspot number (SSN)
 is a solar activity index with long data record. It is 
 frequently used when studying long-term phenomena like 
 climate change, though it may not be the most appropriate 
 index (Georgieva and Kirov, 2006)."
 
 ##**Getting Started**

Simply clone the repository and run the .ipynb file in jupyter
notebook, Goodgle Colabotary, or any other text editor that 
supports the iPython Notebook. And Just click the 'Restart & Run All'
option and the file will run itself...

## **Results**

The Deep Neural Network model achieved the following results:

	Train Score: 5.28 RMSE
	Test Score: 5.37 RMSE
	
This implies that the model achieved around 95% accuracy in its
prediction. You will see the close-proximity in the resemblance
between the actual SSN graph and the predicted SNN graph.
